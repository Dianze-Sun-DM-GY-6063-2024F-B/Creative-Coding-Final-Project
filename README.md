Timid Procedural Creatures

The screen showcases a group of lively procedural creatures, moving randomly as if they possess their own life. Each creature is composed of a segmented body, with each segment smoothly following the head's position and rotation, creating a fluid and dynamic motion.
Through the integration of Arduino and sound sensors, these creatures exhibit a "sensitive response" to external stimuli. When a sudden loud sound occurs in the environment, the creatures react immediately, fleeing to the edges of the screen as if searching for safety. This escape behavior lasts for a few seconds before they gradually calm down and return to their normal random movements.

Procedural Spider

Inspired by a procedural spider walking project I previously created in Unity, I aim to revisit this concept in P5.js. My goal is to simulate the spider's gait and behavior, making it appear natural and lifelike.
The spider's movement is procedurally generated: each leg automatically finds and steps in the position of the previous leg, forming a continuous and smooth walking effect. This algorithm gives the spider's gait a sense of order and even a mechanical aesthetic.
Users can control the spider's direction using a joystick, and press a button to make it weave webs.

Snake Game

This snake game builds upon the classic gameplay while incorporating modern visual effects and innovative mechanics. The snake's body is made up of dynamic geometric shapes, with smooth motion and a touch of inertia. The food may move randomly or hide temporarily, adding challenges to the game. It also introduces reward mechanisms such as speed boosts or visual effects.
Additionally, the game can integrate external devices like Arduino, allowing players to control the snake's movement with a joystick or use sound inputs to trigger jumps or quick turns, breathing new life into the classic snake game with enhanced interactivity.
